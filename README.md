Very eary work on writing a controller for a combat robot.  I'd like the bot to be semi-autonomous in the following ways:
* Use an accelerometer to detect and react to suffering a hit
* Use a magnetometer to understand what direction the bot is posting
* Use either treads or Mecanum wheels to allow for absolute steering, meaning tell the bot to move in a certain cardinal direction (forward, backward, strafe left, strafe right) instead of normal steering (forward, backward, turn left, turn right)

Currently useing an ESP32 - Wroom module and developing in MicroPython
